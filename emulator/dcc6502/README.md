# History tidbit
The original 1.0 version of dcc6502 was written overnight on Christmas eve
1998. At the time, I (Tennessee Carmel-Veilleux) was a 16-year-old NES
hacker learning 6502 assembly. Of course, as many teenagers are, I was
a bit arrogant and really thought my code was pretty hot back then :)
Fast-forward 15 years and I'm a grown-up engineer who is quite a bit more
humble about his code. Looking back, I think the tool did the job, but
obviously, 15 years of experience later, I would have made it quite a
bit cleaner. The disassembler has floated online on miscalleanous NES
development sites since 1998. I decided to put it on github starting at
version 1.4 and I will be cleaning-up the code over until version 2.0. 

This disassembler has made the rounds and has been used for a lot of
different purposes by many different people over the years. Hopefully
it will continue to be useful going forward.
